# Oil-Well-Production-Prediction
This project predicts the daily production of oil wells using advanced machine learning techniques. It involves a comprehensive workflow, including:

* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis.
* Feature Engineering: Applying techniques like SelectKBest and mutual information to optimize input features.
* Model Implementation: Training multiple regression models such as Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Ensemble approaches, including Stacking and Voting Regressors, are employed to enhance predictive performance.
* Evaluation: Models are evaluated based on metrics like RMSE and RÂ² to ensure robust performance.
